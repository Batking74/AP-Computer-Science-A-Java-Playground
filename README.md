# AP-Computer-Science-A-Java-Playground

## Description
This repository serves as a comprehensive documentation of my Senior high school journey in AP CS A, capturing a diverse range of topics. I delved into Java, OOP, sorting algorithms (such as selection sort and insertion sort), ArrayLists, array traversal complexities, and the nuances of class structure and design. Beyond the classroom, my commitment to Java extends into self-directed learning, including the independent development of Android apps using the Android Studio IDE.

Throughout the course, I explored various algorithmic challenges, from devising efficient duplicate finding algorithms to mastering array reversal techniques. I navigated the intricacies of De Morgan's Law, applying it to logical operations. Additionally, I ventured into the realm of ArrayList manipulation with strings, further honing my problem-solving skills.

The journey also encompassed the exploration of recursion, understanding its power and versatility in solving complex problems. I dived into the intricacies of merge sort, gaining insights into efficient sorting techniques.

This repository stands as a testament to my multifaceted growth, showcasing a holistic understanding of Java programming, algorithmic problem-solving, and the artistry of software development.
